### Project Description
A Flask-based chat application that responds to your messages in Gen Z slang and occasionally includes random trending GIFs. The bot uses Groq AI API to generate trendy, casual responses with emojis.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Adults and millennials can't keep up with Gen Z communication styles, slang, and vibe. They need translation help to stay relevant and not sound "cheugy" when talking to younger people.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A chatbot that responds to any message with peak Gen Z energy, complete with slang, emojis, and random GIFs. Now you can practice talking like Gen Z without the judgment of actual teenagers! No cap, fr fr.
